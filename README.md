This is an application developed in Swift for iOS and iPadOS devices that allows you to view the top 250 cryptocurrencies on the market. You can also keep track of the value of your holdings by recording the total amount of a specific coin you own.

This application is built entirely in Swift and uses SwiftUI for the interface. Cryptocurrency information is provided by the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api "CoinGecko API"). User specific information (coin holdings) is stored using CoreData.
